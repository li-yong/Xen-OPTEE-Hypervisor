# Emulate ARM TrustZone on a Virtual Machine

## Motivation
The rise of embedded systems and their integration into critical infrastructure has necessitated enhanced security measures. Hypervisors, while powerful, are vulnerable to attacks, which can compromise all systems running on the hardware. ARM TrustZone provides a solution by creating a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that is isolated from the rest of the system, offering protection against privileged adversaries. This project aims to explore the potential of running Xen hypervisor with support for OP-TEE (TrustZone Software) on a QEMU-emulated ARM environment. By doing so, we can extend the benefits of TrustZone to virtualized environments, enhancing the security of embedded systems.

## Design Goals
- Implement a Xen hypervisor that supports OP-TEE (TrustZone Software) in a QEMU-emulated environment.
- Enable research and benchmarking on the performance and security enhancements offered by TrustZone in virtualized systems.
- Develop a comprehensive understanding of how virtualized systems operate with TrustZone enabled.

## Deliverables
1. **Research and Documentation**:
   - In-depth understanding of hypervisors (Xen) and their interaction with ARM TrustZone.
   - Documentation of the virtualized system workflow and the role of TrustZone in enhancing security.
   
2. **System Setup**:
   - Demonstrate a functional environment running Xen on a QEMU emulator for ARM-based platforms.
   - Provide tutorials for setting up the environment, identifying and resolving errors.
   
3. **Software Development**:
   - Modify the QEMU environment to run OP-TEE using ARM TrustZone.
   - Prepare benchmark for Xen/TrustZone performance evaluation.
   
4. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Run benchmark test on single and multiple guest operating systems.
   - Analyze and report on the performance impact of TrustZone in virtualized environments.

## System Blocks
- **Hypervisor**: Xen hypervisor with OP-TEE support.
- **Virtual Machine Emulator**: QEMU with ARM virtualization extensions.
- **Operating Systems**: Linux for both secure and non-secure environments.
- **Benchmarks**: `xtest` for performance evaluation.

## Hardware/Software Requirements

  - System with virtualization support (Intel VT-x/AMD-V).
  - ARM architecture (emulated via QEMU).
- **Software**:
  - Xen Hypervisor
  - OP-TEE (TrustZone Software)
