\section*{Introduction}

Chiplets are small parts of a big chip. They are like building blocks that can work together to create a larger system. Using chiplets is better than using one big chip because it can improve the manufacturing process. When one small part has a problem, only that part is wasted, not the whole chip. This makes chiplets more cost-effective.

Chiplets also give designers more flexibility. They can mix different types of chiplets, like memory and processors, to build better systems. It is also easier to upgrade. For example, one chiplet can be replaced with a new version while keeping the other chiplets the same.

However, testing chiplets is very difficult. Since they are small and closely packed, it is hard to access the connections between them. Power delivery during testing can also be a problem. High-speed connections, like UCIe, make testing even harder because they need special tools.

This paper will explain the problems in chiplet testing and how researchers are finding ways to solve them. It is based on recent studies about chiplet technologies, focusing on testing methods and challenges.




\section*{Key Challenges in Chiplet Testing}

Chiplet testing has many challenges. One problem is accessibility. It is hard to access the small connections between chiplets, especially in advanced designs like 2.5D and 3D. These connections are tightly packed and hidden, making it hard to test them directly~\cite{An_Improved_Test_Structure_of_Boundary_Scan_Designed_for_2.5D_Integration.pdf}.

Another challenge is power delivery. During testing, power needs to be supplied to the chiplets, but this can cause problems like uneven power distribution or noise. These issues can affect the accuracy of the test results~\cite{Special_Session_Test_Challenges_in_a_Chiplet_Marketplace.pdf}.

Testing interconnects is also complicated. High-speed connections like UCIe need special tools to test their performance. Traditional methods like boundary scan may not work well for these connections~\cite{Efficient_Built-In_Self-Test_Scheme_for_Inter-Die_Interconnects_of_Chiplet-Based_Chips.pdf}.

Finally, there is a lack of standard testing protocols. Different chiplets may come from different vendors, but there are no universal standards to ensure they all work together. This makes testing more difficult and time-consuming~\cite{Special_Session_Test_Challenges_in_a_Chiplet_Marketplace.pdf}.


\section*{Advancements in Testing Methodologies}

Researchers have developed several solutions to address the challenges in chiplet testing. One important improvement is the enhancement of boundary scan techniques. For example, new designs add extra scan cells to improve the visibility of faults in interconnects. This method works well for 2.5D systems, where interposer connections are complex~\cite{An_Improved_Test_Structure_of_Boundary_Scan_Designed_for_2.5D_Integration.pdf}.

Boundary scan, as defined by standards like IEEE 1149.1, has been adapted for chiplet testing. Originally designed for PCB testing, it now provides a framework for testing interconnects in multi-die systems. However, challenges remain. For instance, high-speed interconnects like UCIe push the limits of traditional boundary scan, requiring additional extensions or entirely new approaches. The introduction of IEEE 1838 seeks to address some of these issues by enabling better observability and control in 3D stacked systems. Despite these advancements, achieving compatibility with all chiplet designs remains difficult~\cite{IEEE_11491-2013.pdf}.

Built-In Self-Test (BIST) is another solution. This method integrates testing circuits directly into the chiplets. BIST is especially effective for detecting faults in inter-die interconnects. For example, researchers have shown how BIST can test interconnects in 3D stacked systems with high accuracy and low cost~\cite{Efficient_Built-In_Self-Test_Scheme_for_Inter-Die_Interconnects_of_Chiplet-Based_Chips.pdf}.

Dynamic configuration of test structures is also a new idea. Using a TAP (Test Access Port) controller, chiplets can adapt their test protocols depending on the system requirements. This is helpful when testing heterogeneous systems where chiplets from different vendors are combined~\cite{A_Dynamically_Configurable_Chiplet_Testing_Technology_Based_on_TAP_Controller_Architecture.pdf}.

Finally, there are efforts to standardize testing protocols. Extending IEEE standards, such as IEEE 1149.1, to include UCIe-compatible methods is a critical step. This ensures that testing is consistent and reliable across different chiplet ecosystems~\cite{IEEE_11491-2013.pdf}.


\section*{Relevance to Modern Chiplet Design}

The advancements in chiplet testing directly impact the design and functionality of modern chiplet-based systems. Boundary scan enhancements, for instance, allow manufacturers to identify defects in interposer connections effectively, which is crucial for maintaining reliability in 2.5D architectures~\cite{An_Improved_Test_Structure_of_Boundary_Scan_Designed_for_2.5D_Integration.pdf}. By addressing these defects early, designers can ensure higher yields and better system performance.

Built-In Self-Test (BIST) methodologies simplify testing processes by integrating fault detection mechanisms into the chiplet itself. This is particularly useful in 3D stacked systems, where interconnect faults are harder to detect. BIST not only reduces testing costs but also enhances test coverage, making it an essential tool for high-density chiplet packaging~\cite{Efficient_Built-In_Self-Test_Scheme_for_Inter-Die_Interconnects_of_Chiplet-Based_Chips.pdf}.

Dynamic configuration techniques using TAP controllers provide adaptability for heterogeneous chiplet systems. As chiplets from different vendors may use varying technologies, this approach ensures that each chiplet can be tested effectively without requiring unique tools for each vendor~\cite{A_Dynamically_Configurable_Chiplet_Testing_Technology_Based_on_TAP_Controller_Architecture.pdf}. This flexibility is critical in reducing integration times and improving compatibility across ecosystems.

Standardized protocols like those proposed in IEEE 1149.1 and its extensions enable a universal testing framework. This reduces development time for testing tools and ensures consistency in test results across diverse chiplet designs. Such standardization is key to scaling chiplet technologies for broader industrial adoption~\cite{IEEE_11491-2013.pdf}.

In summary, these testing advancements not only address the technical challenges of chiplet systems but also pave the way for more efficient, scalable, and reliable designs in the semiconductor industry.


\section*{Conclusion and Future Directions}

Chiplet-based designs offer significant benefits in terms of modularity, flexibility, and cost efficiency. However, these advantages come with unique challenges, especially in the area of testing. This paper discussed the main challenges such as accessibility, power delivery issues, and the complexity of high-speed interconnects like UCIe. It also highlighted recent advancements, including improved boundary scan techniques, Built-In Self-Test (BIST), dynamic testing configurations, and the push for standardization~\cite{An_Improved_Test_Structure_of_Boundary_Scan_Designed_for_2.5D_Integration.pdf, Efficient_Built-In_Self-Test_Scheme_for_Inter-Die_Interconnects_of_Chiplet-Based_Chips.pdf, A_Dynamically_Configurable_Chiplet_Testing_Technology_Based_on_TAP_Controller_Architecture.pdf, IEEE_11491-2013.pdf}.

While these advancements address many of the current challenges, there is still much work to be done. Future research should focus on integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning into testing methodologies to predict and detect faults more efficiently. Additionally, improving thermal-aware testing methods will become critical as chiplet systems continue to evolve toward higher performance and density.

Another key area for future exploration is the development of universal testing frameworks that seamlessly integrate across different vendor ecosystems. As chiplet adoption grows, such frameworks will be essential for ensuring interoperability and reducing testing costs.

In conclusion, testing remains a critical factor in the success of chiplet-based architectures. By continuing to innovate and refine testing methodologies, the semiconductor industry can fully realize the potential of chiplets, enabling the next generation of high-performance systems.
